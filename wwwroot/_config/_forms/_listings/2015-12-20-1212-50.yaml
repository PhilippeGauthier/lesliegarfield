XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXPhone Points Border Crossers To Water Technology Designed By State-Funded Research By ELLIOT SPAGAT, Associated Press Writer Elliot Spagat, Associated Press Writer – Tue Dec 29, 7:46 pm ET SAN DIEGO – A group of California artists wants Mexicans and Central Americans to have more than just a few cans of tuna and a jug of water for their illegal trek through the harsh desert into the U.S.Faculty at University of California, San Diego are developing a GPS-enabled cell phone that tells dehydrated migrants where to find water. It also pipes in poetry from phone speakers, regaling them on their journey much like Emma Lazarus' words did a century ago to the  huddled masses yearning to breathe free  on Ellis Island.The Transborder Immigrant Tool is part technology endeavor, part art project. It introduces a high-tech twist to an old debate about how far activists can go to prevent migrants from dying on the border without breaking the law.Immigration hardliners argue the activists are aiding illegal entry to the United States, a felony. Even migrants and their sympathizers question whether the device will make the treacherous journeys easier.The designers — three visual artists on UCSD's faculty and an English professor at the University of Michigan — are undeterred as they criticize a U.S. policy they say embraces illegal immigrants for cheap labor while letting them die crossing the border. It's about giving water to somebody who's dying in the desert of dehydration,  said Micha Cardenas, 32, a UCSD lecturer.The effort is being done on the gov There are many, many areas in which every American would say I don't like the way my tax dollars are being spent. Our answer to that is an in-your-face, so what?  says UCSD lecturer Brett Stalbaum, 33, a self-described news junkie who likens his role to chief technology officer. ernment's dime — anThe designers, who have raised $15,000 from a UCSD grant and an art festival award, hope to hand out phones for free in Mexico. The phones sell used for about $30 apiece. It costs nothing to add the GPS software.Distribution would be tightly controlled by migrant shelters and advocacy groups to keep them away from anti-illegal immigration activists. The migrants would need passwords to use them.U.S. authorities are unfazed. The Border Patrol has begun a $6.7-billion plan to drape the border with whiz-bang cameras, sensors and other technology. It's nothing new,  said Border Patrol spokesman Mark Endicott.  We've seen handheld GPS devices used by smugglers.   We're just going to have to learn to adapt to any challenges. Critics of illegal immigration say the device is misguided, at best. If it's not a crime, it's very close to committing a crime,  said Peter Nunez, a former U.S. attorney in San Diego.  Whether this constitutes aiding and abetting would depend on the details, but it certainly puts you in the discussion.  irony not lost on the designers whose salaries are paid by the state of California EDIT   here is part of the article not posted.
