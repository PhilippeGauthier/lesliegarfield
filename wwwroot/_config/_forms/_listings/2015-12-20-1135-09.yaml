message: "miya より:Hi RyuVery good to hear from you. How's life in Boston?Actually there are lot's of Condos there which were converted in to luaurxy cond's from hotels before they were started their construction.I don't know the exact reson why, but anyway I saw some of them such us Jean Nouvel's and HdeM's around Soho. They are now under consrtuction. You will see Nouvel's has almost done the exterior, but the latter has just exposed its concrete structure so far.Of course their rents are surprising. While the new upper class are living in Brooklyn such as along L-line rising up the average incomes and rents of the areas, the luxury Manhattan areas such as around Soho are boosting up its prestigious states by rebuilding brand new buildings.What's also amazing is Prada in Soho designed by OMA has been rearranged the interior. Its first floor was originally designed as only a kind of  show window'/ void space, and the basement was for retail for men/women. But now the first floor is just a men's floor and the basement floor is for women. The charming cabinet designed by SANAA seemed in no use. It seems the fundamental idea well-organized   Programing space' has totally gone. It is sadly just a commercial space like others swallowed into  Sohoism'."
