message: "still have it backwards in that you think that the preoblm here is tied to printing.First, a FRN is not a treasury or a bond, which most nation's buy when they buy government debt.Second, of those treasuries/bonds 90% (or more) of those transactions are done electronically.Third, when it comes to FRNs and buying goods in dollars - the amount of goods that nations buy in dollars (say for example China buying barrels of oil) makes it impossible to buy those in physical dollars (they would need an oil tanker alone to transport that amount of physical bills to the bank each day!). So they turn to computers and credit!And fourth, you need to step out of the 30s, for the printing press is dead. Trading goods for dollars, and buying government treasuries/bonds electronically has been happening since the late 50s.Hell, the vast majority of Americans don't even use cash anymore...LOL, the crisis revolves around printing.. my ass!"
