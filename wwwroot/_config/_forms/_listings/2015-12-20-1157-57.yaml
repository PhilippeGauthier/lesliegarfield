message: 'September 18, 2012 at 10:40 pm</a>There is a huge crisis going on right now. Nobody is getntig paid enough. That is by nobody, we mean Oprah Winfrey, Judge Judy and Kate Gosslin. “We’ve joined together to stop our bosses from reducing our salaries because we’re already poor enough already!” said Oprah in a press conference last week. She along with the others are also suing with the legal help of Judge Judy, who also is getntig threatened for a lower salary. “My producer, Jennifer Stocks, threatened to cut my salary because I caused so much trouble in my divorce with Jon. I can barely support my eight kids as it is. I normally buy them maybe fifteen new outfits per month from their favorite designers. Also, I can’t afford my 50 plastic surgeries, hair appointments and make up!” Kate Gosslin states, obviously outraged at her pay cut from 5.8 million dollars a year to only 4.4 million a year. But, amongst all of this celebrity protest, there is a group of everyday middle class people standing up against all of these celebrities, outraged at the fact that that group of TV icons are acting so stupidly. “We’ve had enough with hearing how celebrities look down on us because of our money. But, hearing them complain about the money pushed us to the edge and we had just had it with all of them.” Explained Guava Snellenberger, the leader of the Celebrities are Stupid group. “We have done several protests against the celebrities and have met with their producers and whoever is in charge of them, and put in a word to them that they should refrain from any pay raises and that the actors even deserve less,” stated Snellenberger after a press conference. “For now I’m taking the roll of a lawyer for my group,” says Judge Judy while walking down the road to her local Walgreens, “My clients believe that the little lower-class brats going against our cause should start supporting us. Any second we could each dish out a million dollars and pay to have each and every one of them disposed of and never come back again.” The Celebrities are Stupid people could not stand for this and lead a public rally against the actors and actresses once again. “We are frowned upon by the celebrities because we aren’t as wealthy as they are. Now they insult the average human who earns about the salaries of 360 middle class Americans combined. How? They are asking for more money when they don’t need it and it could go to the poor, or to charities. But it doesn’t.” At that rally they had a guest speaker, Joe, who made the point of the night. “There are Americans who only make a couple thousand a year, and they work so much harder than any Hollywood actor or actress. Garbage men, sewer cleaners, accountants, etc. They all work harder and matter as much as any celebrity.” The celebrities didn’t take any of this kindly. They sent Oprah to talk to us in our office today to talk with us, she told us that she, “doesn’t care about how little average Americans get” and that all she cares about is money. She also revealed that she was about to build an extension to her house, and buy a private island for her and her boyfriend. When we asked how much money that would be, it was a steep 300,000,000 dollars. We asked if she was going to be in any debt, and replied “No” and that she would actually have a billion dollar surplus. Yes, Oprah you do need a salary increase. We totally agree with you. If you got another billion dollars you could buy the world. What’s going to happen to the celebrities, you ask? Well we still don’t know. But if it is an enormous pay cut, the whole United States could benefit from that extra billion dollars circulating around. BREAKING NEWS! The President, Barack Obama, says that all celebrities can’t get any pay cuts because they “keep our economy going”? Well, he obviously doesn’t support his average Americans. “What is this!? If there were a vote for celebrity salary reduction there would only be 100 people who would be for high celebrity salaries!” Raged Snellenberger, “I guess that we’re just going to have to protest stronger against the president AND celebrities. Hold on to your hats America, this could be interesting!”'
