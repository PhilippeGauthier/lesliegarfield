message: "it's the minting of the FRN that gives the dlolar it's overvalued status.  The physical dlolar is just made of cotton and linen.  The electronic dlolar is just made of electronic digits on a computer.  Neither of these have much value and the govt. can't mint electronic digits nor does it produce cotton/linin but it can mint cotton/linen in to a sheet of paper which is where the govt. makes it's money and gives the dlolar it's over valued state as the govt. charges so much to make a dlolar(which is called seignorage), that gives the dlolar so much more value.  When the govt. fails at printing/minting enough FRNs to meet demand, the action that was giving the dlolar it's over valued state will have ended.  If the govt. is not able to print/mint the FRNs in a timely manner people will not accept what they are charging to mint it.  It's like the deal Domino's Pizza used to have.  If the Pizza was 30 minutes late it was half off or free.  This is what will happen to the dlolar when the govt. fails to print enough FRNs to meet demand."
