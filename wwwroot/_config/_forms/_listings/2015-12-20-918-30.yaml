  we've been over this electronic VS ptirning many times.I think it's been time times now (including this one).I'm sure you understand it.Yes I understand what you are saying...You just refuse to accept it.Right, because it's a false assumption as you stated:"And if the govt. ...fails to print enough FRNs, this too will devalue the dollar..."Again the government need not print money like it was the 30s...All it needs to do is add 0's to the number that sits in a computer.Thus, to say how "fail[ing] to print enough FRNs" leads to the devalue of the dollar is an argument based on insanity...For not only do you have the issue ass backwards, but you also fail to understand that the Feds are not dependent on the ptirning press when all they need to do is add 0's from a keyboard.
