You can get more cotton and linen for your buck if you bought it on the market than hoarding FRNs for it's puny 1gram of cotton and linen.Hoarding the base metal coins maybe a different issue since they are not as over valued.  And if you can't afford precious metals I guess hoarding base metals isn't a bad idea."
