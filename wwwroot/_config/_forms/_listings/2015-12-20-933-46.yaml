message: "Hi Pat!  Long time no speak!I followed the innstuctiors, and When I click on the  tiger.xml  on the browser it doesn't appear with the modified height= 350 , strange because its saved, and it shows up in the  preview  just not when I go to the URL.  Its because of the cache  since we're naming it the same name as your original tiger.xml, its not saving properly.. I renamed it test.xml and it worked fine.Thx, for the tutorials!  neat stuff"
