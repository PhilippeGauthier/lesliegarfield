  ... "For example, with all these bank batoiuls... do you think they deposited 700 billion (and more) in physical money in the various banks?If you do I really need the drugs you are taking..." Anonymous what proof or logic do you have that the 700 billion dollars was not physical money and was in "fact" electronic money?  There is no proof or logic to your reasoning so maybe you're the one on drugs. "Numonic, the facts above as well as other facts prove that the banks are not in short supply of money, physical or digital." Everything you said above suggests the banks are in shortage of money.  And I don't think it's possible to have a shortage of electronic money.  The closest thing to having a shortage of electronic money that I can think of is if you had $30,000 in your bank account one minute and the next minute with out you withdrawing or transferring any of that money from your savings, your savings account read $10,000.  And in that case you wouldn't say the bank has a shortage of electronic money and if the bank tried to tell you they had a shortage of electronic money when this happened and you believed them, you would belong in the nut house.  Imagine the bank trying to explain to you that it doesn't have enough able people working at the bank to push the numerical keys on the keyboard lol.  I mean that's the only possible way for those electronic numbers not to be in your account.  The only possible way is if there is no one the bank can find to punch the numbers on a keyboard.  Meaning every bank teller and every human being on earth(except people that worked for the Fed of course since they are the one's doing this supposed "electronic" bailout) was struck with rigormortis in there hands and there was no functioning hand on earth or at least a shortage of functioning hands(the people that work for the Fed being the last people on earth with functioning hands).  How ridiculous does that sound?On top of that you contradict yourself.  As ridiculous as it sounded, you said the batoiuls were electronic money and then you contradicted yourself and said the banks are not short of money(digital or physical).  If the banks are not short of money, why would they be getting a "bailout"?Forget it don't answer that.  You'll probably just talk about some conspiracy the banks are doing to get more money and you can scratch that because no one is getting richer, everyone is getting poorer.   I can't believe I'm even trying to explain this.Anonymous I'm done, you can't be serious.  I think you're just playing stupid to see how far I would go to play along.  You got me.  Good for you, you got me to play along to your stupid act.  I actually fell for it.  I actually thought you were that stupid.  LOL  Good Joke.Well Anonymous, I guess we are just going to have to agree to disagree.
