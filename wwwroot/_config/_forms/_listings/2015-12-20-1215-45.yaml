My general idea for the whole paper was to start out talking about the origins and tech, arcade (decline too), home consoles, 2d to 3d, mmos and virtual worlds and finally the violence and sexuality. (general outline not specifics) but here's the statementVideo games have gone through many changes throughout the years. Weâ€™ve gone from a friendly game of Pong to hardcore exhibitions of Gears of War. Throughout the history of the video games, developers push for far better production levels on the part of graphics and realism. Through the realism, the issue of violence and sexuality has become a prominent controversy and popular topic among gamers and the press.is it ok so far? I need to wrap it up with one more sentence. but i can't find the words to conclude it any ideas? (i can't say  i'll be exploring this )"
