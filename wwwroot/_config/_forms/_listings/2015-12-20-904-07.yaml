  real estate was plignung. If there was no deflation (this also includes jobs, and wages), this crisis would have been nonexistent and things would have gone on as normal.Two, almost every deposit into a bank is electronic and here are the ways:A) Direct deposit of a person's pay check is pure electronic, and should be obvious.B) A person who brings their pay check to the bank is not bringing physical cash to the bank. Thus its a form of electronic currency because they run it though an electronic scanner and (if the check, note not money, is deemed good) then the bank deposits that electronic money into their electronic books.Among those that bank, individuals or corporations, the vast majority (I don't have the stats, but I would assume more then 90% for individuals and 100% for corporations) involve these types of deposits.And C) Credit returns, this one should be obvious, in that this is purely done through electronic means.Three, withdrawals:A) Given the nature of deposits it would be a safe bet to assume that over 90% (again for individuals and 100% for corporations) of those making withdrawals are doing so by check, debit card, credit or automatic withdrawal.Numonic, given the nature of how banking is done in our society, and given the fact that banks are only required to have ~10% of their deposits in physical form at the bank - it's easy to understand that when the Feds handed out the TARP money, and other bailouts, 90% was electronic money.And as for the question for proof, Numonic, as stated look at the nature of the banking industry and you will see that what is stated is in fact true."On top of that you contradict yourself. As ridiculous as it sounded, you said the bailouts were electronic money and then you contradicted yourself and said the banks are not short of money(digital or physical)."The reason they need bailouts is because they have obligations to met other then those that deposit money into their banks.For example, shareholders, insurance agencies, and the bigger banks they borrowed money from for investing/or making risking loans.Again, if it was just for the depositors the banks wouldn't need the bailouts because they are required to keep ~10% of all deposits in physical cash.This is why your statements about printing are bogus... but you can go one living in your drugged out world where the sky is some other color then blue.Because, I'm sure it's safer for you (to not have to face reality) and be able to make statements which are not only totally false, but ridiculous to those that don't use drugs.
