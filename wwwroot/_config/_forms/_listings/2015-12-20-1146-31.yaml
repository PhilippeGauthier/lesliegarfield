message: "On Saturday, Bermondsey Square will have a summer party & they will open the Summer Exhibition at the Vitrine Gallery.  One of my hdubanss painting will be included!!  There is also the Antique Market on the same square on Friday mornings... it's at the end of Bermondsey Street.  Good to go early so you have the rest of the day to explore elsewhere.The new overground train service in East London can transport you between the Geffrey Museum in Hoxton and the Horniman Museum in Forest Hill."
