  Hi Tom,You wrote "If you assume 60% is coerrct - well, I don't know what to say."Most comments here are based on the assumption that "choose at random" implies that all answers have the same probability of being selected. Since that has not been stated in the question, in my opinion even "c) 60%" could be the right answer.For example, you could "choose at random" by rolling a 20-sided die and pick answer "a) 25%" if the outcome is 1..2, "b) 50%" if it is 3..4, "c) 60%" if it is 5..16 and "d) 25%" if it is 17..20. When you follow this procedure, then 60% of the time, you will pick the answer "c) 60%".Erwin.
