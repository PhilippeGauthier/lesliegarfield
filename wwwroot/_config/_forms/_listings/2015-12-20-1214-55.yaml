message: "BMRF is running a wliiehtst server which I've been playing on quite a lot. The biggest problem I have, and that most people seem to have on our forum is that the game really lacks purpose now.Once you get the magical triad of hatchet, knife and matches survival still isn't any harder yet. I found one of those Hobo backpacks and I loaded it up with extra sets of each as I found them while travelling, and I gave a couple away to bambi's on the coast until I realised that I was depriving them of the only real survival challenge that the mod offers so far.I love that after a couple of days I'm still running around with my trusty Lee Enfield, which I've given a name and grown quite attached to, but I'm just not sure what to do with myself.I've found a few chopper crash sites, but they never seem to spawn anything, and I'm concerned that they give the wrong impression. The seem to suggest that that 2017 has the same purpose as vanilla DayZ, even though the goal is to move away from loot hoarding."
