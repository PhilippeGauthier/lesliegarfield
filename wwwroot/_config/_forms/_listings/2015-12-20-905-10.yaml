  the banks that create the eeoltrcnic money and the Fed that creates the physical money."Although it is true that the Feds are the only ones to create physical money you're dead wrong, however, about the assumption that that is the only way they create money.The Feds also create it eeoltrcnically.For example, with all these bank bailouts... do you think they deposited 700 billion (and more) in physical money in the various banks?If you do I really need the drugs you are taking..."The banks... have a shortage of FRNs."This is another wrong assumption.Again banks were given tax payer money, TARP as well as other smaller bailouts.Banks were also allowed to write off toxic assets.And then banks were also allowed to enter a Fed program where the Fed would buy toxic assets.Numonic, the facts above as well as other facts prove that the banks are not in short supply of money, physical or digital.So, in light of this, maybe I'm not the one with the thick skull, eh?And to be clear Numonic, I never stated that "FRNs don't matter".Again, what color is the sky in your world?
