The raindrops began to grow stronger and I had to squint to see where I was running. Panting, I wiped sweat off of my forehead and continued to run. The Sun had suddenly disappeared behind a big, dark cloud. Please let me live, I thought to myself. I wished Crane or Riley were here right now. Crane would have told me to run ahead while he stayed to fight off the enemy. Riley would have stayed by my side and made sure I was safe. I started to cry, remembering I would never see them again. “Gotcha!” All my hopes of escaping had come to an end. I hadn’t realized I was at a dead end when they threw me in the back of their van. Cold and scared, I huddled into a corner to keep warm. Two men climbed in the back with me to make sure I didn’t escape. One of the men took out a bottle labeled “sleep powder”. I didn’t have the strength to fight back as they sprinkled it over me. The last thing I remember was the faint noise of someone calling my name. 6 MONTHS EARLIER: “Don’t you just adore the summer, Casey darling?” my mother asked me. “Why, of course Mother. What is there not to love?” I replied. “Mildred! I’d liked an iced coffee and a Pillsbury cinnamon bun,” my mother ordered one of our many servants. As Mildred walked off, I thought about how easy I had it. While everyone else was working on their summer reading, here I was, getting a nice tan. I was the only one in my grade that had a seven story mansion, with an elevator. Everybody else used coupons, whatever those are. They shop at thrift stores and outlets while I only buy from top designers. My life was paradise. Little did I know, in a few short months I would be facing death.My step-dad is probably the richest man here in Brookeville. He owns almost everything. On the other hand, my real dad barely managed to pay the bills. I hate spending time with him. He can’t hold down a simple job and his wife (my step-mom) isn’t any better. “Casey, your father will be here soon to pick you up.” I shrugged, “Mother, why do I even bother to communicate with him and take part in his lower-class life?” “Because he’s your father and I don’t want you to ever say that again. Now, go to your room and have Amanda help you pack,” she said in a stern voice. I hopped onto our elevator and told Jason to press floor 5. As I stepped onto my floor, I wondered which room had the dress I bought this morning. Oh, well. It’s only money, as my mother would say. I walked into closet #2 and Amanda packed my things. I made sure she hired a pet groomer because my poor dog, Princess, was getting filthy. As I ordered a latte to my room, a servant told me my father was here. I went back outside to my mother and air kissed her goodbye. “Behave and don’t forget to call me later!” she said, as I walked to the front porch. I saw my dad waiting outside of his car. When he saw me, he smiled from ear to ear. “Casey! Hi, honey!” he said, giving me a hug. “Hello, father.” I said, getting into the passenger seat. “Uh, I see you cut your hair.” he said, trying to make conversation. I nodded. The rest of the car ride went on like this. Him trying to make conversation and I, giving him one-word answers. “Sweetie, I know I may not be able to give you a mansion or a huge allowance every week. But, I love you and I’m sorry that I’m not as close to you.” I felt bad for him. He really did care about me. I looked at him and said, “Dad, I don’t hate you or anything. I’m just not used to your lifestyle and I think it’d be nice if you could hold down a job for longer than a day.” “Casey, I can. The job I have is the reason your mother and I divorced. I think you’re old enough to know what my real career is,” he said, pulling up into his driveway. He opened the glove compartment and took out a note. He asked me to read it aloud. After reading it, I realized how much danger he put himself into when he went to work. And more importantly, I realized how much danger I was in. “Dad…” I started. Unable to finish the sentence, I looked at the note again. (THERE WOULD BE A NOTE HERE BUT THE FORMAT DOESNT ALLOW IT. it would say that her dad works for this guy that wants to take over the world)“Explain!” I told him. “Well, James was a friend of mine in high school. He was a top student and always wondered why everyone else couldn’t be as perfect. He wanted to create a world where there are no mistakes and everything is wonderful. He became a scientist and started testing his world of perfection on humans. He gave them supernatural powers and wants to do the same for the rest of the world. I agree and think his plan is a great idea! My wife, Malory, is working for him along with other people across the country.” “So basically, you’re working for Hitler and enjoy it?” I asked. “No, Casey. You don’t seem to understand.” “I understand that you’re a maniac!” I said, getting ou'
