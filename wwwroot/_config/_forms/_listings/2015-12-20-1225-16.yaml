message: I was playing your sreevr all night, and came across 2 players repairing a bus. Tracked them from the Factory near Polana, killed one with a hatchet. Then heard the other running up from the side, and we broke each others legs. I had a revolver secondary so after we both crawled away from each other I got up and shot him.I was promptly kicked from the sreevr, tried getting back on a few times. Was pretty fun, but kinda bullshit getting kicked/banned for that.
