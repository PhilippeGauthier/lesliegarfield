  Happy Holidays!
  
  I recently passed my NY Licensing Exam and will be able to start working beginning of February when my current job ends. In preparation for the change of industry (I currently co-manage a Domestic Care Employment Agency) I've put in hours of research, reading whatever I can get my hands on and speaking to as many professionals as possible.
  
  I am a young, energetic, and ambitious individual, with a strong work ethic and a burning desire to thrive in the industry. Above all else, I am looking for the opportunity to prove myself and want to ensure I start my career at the right company, surround myself with the right people, and give myself access to the tools and knowledge necessary to accomplish everything I set out to do.
  
  I would love to come in for an interview and learn more about your company. Next week Wednesday works best for me, but I am free all week. Please let me know if and when you can accommodate.
  
  Kind Regards,
  Avi Muller
