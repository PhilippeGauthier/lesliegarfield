summary_intro: "A substantial double fronted detached house arranged over five floors retaining a wealth of period features. There is a superb artist's studio at the rear, added by the original owner, Dr Mort, for his two daughters who were painters. Dr Mort himself is said to have been physician to Queen Mary. There is also a large studio in the garden added more recently. Bassett Road was originally a private road, with a gate at each end, developed by The St Quintin Estate in the 1860's-70's for commuters using the Metropolitan Line extension opened in 1864. Whilst the property is in excellent order, the room sizes and features are all much as they would originally have been. The property passed from the daughters of Dr Mort to their maid and has only changed hands twice since then. Bassett Road is situated off Ladbroke Grove and is close to all local amenities and transport facilities. Accommodation - Entrance hall, drawing room, dining room, ground floor kitchen, lower ground floor kitchen, master bedroom suite including a dressing room, 5 further bedrooms, library/artists studio, 2 guest bathrooms and 2 cloakrooms. Amenities include a gym, summer house/artist's studio, plant room, vault, balcony, terrace and garden."
