summary_full: "<p>This stately townhouse is a nineteen-foot wide brick stone residence, complete with a private backyard garden. Originally constructed in 1899, over a century later, this elegant edifice has been architecturally refurbished and technologically transformed into a modern twenty-first century residence. </p><p>Truly, a marriage of classic pre-war elegance and modern day luxury; featuring interior crown moldings, six fireplaces, and preserved architectural details.Ten well-proportioned rooms- including four bedrooms, three full baths, one half bath, magnificent eleven foot ceilings on the second floor, and a full basement. The bedroom suites, located on the upper levels of the home, all have fireplaces and generous closets. The master suite, located on the fourth floor, is flooded with sunlight from its three large south facing windows and connects to a private fifth floor room measuring approximately thirteen feet wide by twenty feet in length, making for an impressive master dressing room or second office. </p><p>The living room, located on the second floor of the residence, ushers guests from the parlor level dining room into a bright and relaxed entertaining space, which leads into the library at the back of the second floor. The library is a tranquil escape, complete with two custom floor-to-ceiling bookcases that frame a beautiful fireplace and a door leading to an outside terrace that sits above the patio and garden below. </p><p>The first floor provides a grand dining room that leads to the back eat-in-kitchen. The kitchen features marble countertops, stainless steel appliances, elegant white cabinetry, custom built-in shelving and French doors that open to the patio and private backyard garden. The garden is set among the trees and has been thoughtfully designed with lush landscaping, handsome stonework, and a serene fountain. </p><p>This unique offering is perfectly positioned among the historical residences of Turtle Bay Gardens and Beekman Place, and was built in tandem with Manhattans' growing real estate boom of the early 1900s. Today, this townhouse sits just one block from the former site of the famous Beekman Family mansion, Mount Pleasant. The residence is also one block from the East River and the tree-lined enclave of Beekman Place, one block north of the United Nations and is centrally located for heading south to Grand Central Station or traveling north to Central Park and the fine shops, restaurants, museums, and galleries of the Upper East Side.<br></p>"
