summary_intro: Behind the most unique carved doors in Chelsea lies space and elegance rarely seen in Manhattan. Available for the first time in over 20 years, the Samuel Turner House offers a unique opportunity to own a magnificent and grand piece of New York history. Each floor of 1,675 gracious square feet is married to 14-foot, 12-foot and 10-foot high ceilings that capture the essence of grand living. Sharply etched acanthus leaf crown molding; one gorgeous marble fireplace after another; handmade 10 to 8-foot high doors; marquetry galore; enormous windows with their original shutters, are but a few of the treats found inside this immense 25-foot wide mansion.
summary_full: |
  <hr><p>Rebuilt with privacy and quiet in mind, this building is a calm oasis on Chelsea’s best block. West 22nd Street, which can only be entered by vehicles going north on 10th Avenue, boasts it’s own private park; a splendid mixture of early and late 19th century townhomes; plus rows of old-style gaslights. Among the many surprises – which can’t be seen – are extensive between floor soundproofing and a third pane of glass laminated into each and every front window. The open spaces on the east and west sides of the last 15 feet of this magnificent 67-foot long building are just waiting for a wall of windows.
  </p><p>So step into 440 West 22nd Street where the elegance of a bygone era meets 21st century engineering, providing the ultimate in undisturbed tranquility. Enjoy your own four-season garden, and watch dozens of perennials bloom as the seasons and butterflies glide by.
  </p><p>Set between Ninth and Tenth Avenues, in the heart of the famed Chelsea Seminary District, you are merely steps away from the trendy High Line Park and New York's chic art gallery district. Also nearby are the Chelsea Market; the Chelsea Piers sports complex; the new Hudson River Park; Youngwoo’s new SuperPier; and a wide variety of upscale restaurants and shops.
