  GARDEN & PARLOR MAISONETTE 
  
  Behind the most unique carved doors in Chelsea lies space and elegance rarely seen in Manhattan. Imagine an exquisitely rebuilt Grand Parlor with 14 pilasters, each 10 feet high; 13-foot ceilings; sharply etched acanthus leaf crown molding; two gorgeous marble fireplaces; handmade 10 to 8-foot high doors; marquetry galore; enormous windows with their original shutters; and you will have a sense of this rarely seen or photographed 1835 historic gem.
summary_full: "<p>Considered Chelsea’s original grand mansion, each floor is 1,675 square feet; this superb building was rebuilt with privacy and quiet in mind. The current owner spared no expense, used the best craftsmen and superior materials to turn this building into a calm oasis. Long acknowledged as Chelsea’s best block, West 22nd Street, which can only be entered by vehicles going north on 10th Avenue, boasts it’s own private park; a splendid mixture of early and late 19th century townhomes; plus rows of old-style gaslights. Among this mansion's many surprises – which can’t be seen – are extensive (between floor) sound proofing; a third pane of glass that is laminated into each and every front window; plus the open space on the east and west sides of the last 15 feet of this magnificent 67-foot long building that is just waiting for a wall of windows to be installed...<br><br>So step into 440 West 22nd Street where the elegance of a bygone era meets 21st century engineering, providing the ultimate in undisturbed quiet and privacy. This potential duplex is the real thing: a true Maisonette, a house within a house. Use the under-the-stoop entrance, which enters directly into the Garden Level, boasting enormous bedrooms; marble baths; plus a charming 31-foot long living room that looks out onto an exquisitely curated garden. Or use the up-the-stoop entrance that enters into the grand spaces of the Parlor level. Either way you’ll enjoy your own four-season garden, and watch dozens of perennials bloom as the seasons and the butterflies glide by.<br><br>Set between Ninth and Tenth Avenues, in the heart of the famed Chelsea Seminary District, you are merely steps away from the trendy High Line Park and New York's chic art gallery district. Also nearby are the Chelsea Market; the Chelsea Piers sports complex; the new Hudson River Park; Youngwoo’s new SuperPier; and a wide variety of upscale restaurants and shops. Yet, West 22nd Street remains untouched, graced with remarkably low traffic — it’s a quiet isle with an unusually small population that frequently forgets to lock their doors. <br><br>THE FACTS<br><br>* 25’ x 67’ On Two Levels  <br>* 3,350 Sq.
