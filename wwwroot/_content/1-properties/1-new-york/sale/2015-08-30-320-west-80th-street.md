summary_intro: Prior to its urbanization in the late 1800s, the Riverside Drive-West 80th-81st Street Historic Distric was part of a neighborhood known as Bloomingdale, in recollection of a flower-growing region of the same name near Haarlem, in Holland. In 1895-1900 the architect/owner Clarence True constructed several townhouse block fronts in the area and as such, True is considered largely responsible for development of the Drive. By the turn of the century, the area along Riverside Park had evolved into one of the most fashionable residential neighborhoods in the City. In 1899, one observer noted that West End Avenue “was one of the finest residential streets in New York City, while Riverside Drive was universally acknowledged to be one of the most beautiful and picturesque streets in the world.”
summary_full: '<p>320 West 80th Street was designed by True as one of eight attached townhomes built in the Elizabethan Renaissance Revival style. Consistent with True’s iconic design, the staircase is set in the center of the house. The stair placement allows for the major rooms to utilize the full width of the house, creating what is tantamount to three-room suites with two generous rooms in the front and rear. This historic house retains its impeccable original detail including eight original fireplaces and extensive use of original oak and mahogony paneling, pocket doors, floors, beams, and stairs. Containing over 6,500 square feet, this majestic 85’ deep home offers four to five bedrooms, two kitchens, a large dining room, a library, a family room, a sky-lit media room, an elevator, six-zone central air conditioning, and a tranquil south-facing garden. In close proximity to Riverside Park, an array of fine schools, Lincoln Center, and transportation and commerce on Broadway, 320 West 80th Street truly represents the finest in Upper West Side townhouse living.<span></span><br></p>'
