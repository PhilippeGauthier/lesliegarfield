summary_intro: "Extra wide two-family townhouse situated on a lovely block between First and York Avenues that is delivered vacant. Wonderful opportunity exists to renovate the owner's three bedroom, three and a half bath triplex unit while continuing to get income from the top floor 2 bedroom plus separate office unit. Other option is to convert the whole thing into a magnificent single family home. Significant air rights are intact to build up and back with a max usable FAR of 8,600 square feet. Steps from Carl Schurz Park, this house is neither landmarked or in a historic district. Abundant original details remain intact including three woodburning fireplaces, graciously sized rooms, moldings, and high ceilings."
