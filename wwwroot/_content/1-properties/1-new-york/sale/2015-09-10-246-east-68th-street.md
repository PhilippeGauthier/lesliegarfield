summary_intro: 'In 1884, the developer John D. Crimmins built the row of brownstones from 222 to 252 East 68th, and The Real Estate Record & Guide said, “No more than six of them will look alike, and no monotony will spoil the aspect of this new row of houses.'
summary_full: |
  <p dir="ltr" rel="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">The houses at 240 and 246 — designed by Mr. Litchfield and by Chester Patterson, respectively, in full-blown Georgian-revival style — have traditionally been the most arresting on the street. 246 East 68th Street retains much of the charm and character of yesteryear with its well proportioned rooms, expansive and beautifully landscaped garden, and three wood-burning fireplaces.
  </p><p>The first floor includes the kitchen and dining room which opens on to the garden. The second floor has the formal entertaining space including a spacious living room and wood paneled library and the top two floors have four generous bedrooms. The property also retains over three thousand square feet of air rights allowing for additional square footage and the opportunity to create truly grand home in the heart of the Upper East Side.
