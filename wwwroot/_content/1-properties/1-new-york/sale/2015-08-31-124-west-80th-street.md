summary_intro: 124 West 80th Street is a classic, 20 foot wide, Renaissance Revival townhouse designed by the architect Theodore Thomson in 1894. Situated on a beautiful, extra quiet, Museum of Natural History park block, filled with wide, five-story bow fronted townhouses, this property is comprised of seven units and contains a spacious south-facing garden, and a highly desirable sixth floor apartment with roof deck and views of the park. Several of the units have outdoor space, contributing to the high rent roll of $394,000 that is attained through the leasing of furnished apartments. With net operating income of approximately $300,000, this property is ideal for investors looking for cash flow or for purchasers looking to convert the townhouse into a grand single family home.
