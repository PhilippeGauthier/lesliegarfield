description: 'Midtown is the place to be for buyers who want easy access to, well, everything. Full of the hustle and bustle that defines New York, Midtown East truly has it all. Local shopping includes world- famous Bergdorf ’s and Bloomingdales. The neighborhood park is none other than magnificent Central Park and the diplomatic playground of the UN plaza offers dramatic views of the Queensboro Bridge and Roosevelt Island. Dining options down the street include Michelin- starred restaurants. With the elegance and calm of the East Side and the energy of Midtown, your neighborhood’s appeal is clear.'
