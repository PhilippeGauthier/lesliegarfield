description: Chelsea. The place to be. The innovative High Line park and the new Whitney have brought new energy to the historical neighborhood that was once replete with only townhouse streets. It has also ushered in a new focus on real estate. Famously home to artists and galleries galore, your neighborhood is quickly gaining ground with tech entrepreneurs, too. Great restaurants and shopping only add to the appeal. As Chelsea continues to develop and transform with hip restaurants, fresh retail and new architecture,it is a hot ticket for buyers today.
