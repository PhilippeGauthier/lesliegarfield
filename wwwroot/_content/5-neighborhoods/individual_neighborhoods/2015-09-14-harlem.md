description: Famous for its cultural history of influential artists, writers and musicians, the neighborhood is now gaining attention for its rapid surge in development. Columbia Universityâ€™s influence can be seen spreading from the west side toward the east. With a combination of fine original townhouses and modern high-rises, Harlem is becoming a beautiful intersection of the old and the new. Easy access to Central Park, Morningside Park and Marcus Garvey Park add to the high desirability of your neighborhood.
