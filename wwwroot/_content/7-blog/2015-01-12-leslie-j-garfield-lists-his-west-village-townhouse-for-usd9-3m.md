<p>Townhouse expert and founder of the eponymous residential brokerage Leslie J. Garfield is listing a Greenwich Village property he’s owned for nearly half a century for $9.25 million.</p><p>The 1836 Greek Revival townhouse at 313 West 4th Street is one of two townhouses Garfield has owned since 1969 and is part of a personal investment portfolio of properties that includes commercial and mixed-use buildings, said Leslie J. Garfield broker Matt Lesser, who has the listing for the home.<br></p><p>Garfield and Lesser worked with the architectural firm SPG and the Landmarks Preservation Commission to come up with a set of approved plans that expand the 20-foot-wide home from 3,600 square feet to just under 4,800 square feet.<br></p><p>“The major things that were approved were the fifth-floor setback addition and the redesign of the façade,” Lesser said. “It’s a tremendous amount of value in time. It’s saving 11 months of both headaches and basically writing checks.”<br></p><p>Property records show Garfield has owned the home between Banks Street and West 12th Street since 1969, though no price was recorded. Lesser said the retired brokerage founder never lived in the rental property, which has been vacant for several months.<br></p><p>Garfield is also selling a townhouse he owns on the Upper East Side, 107 East 91st Street. That building, which has been on and off the market since 2009, is asking $7.75 million. Matthew Pravda of Leslie J. Garfield has the listing.<br></p><p>See more <a href="http://therealdeal.com/blog/2015/01/12/leslie-j-garfield-lists-his-west-village-townhouse-for-9-3m/#sthash.IZW4H67j.dpuf">here</a>. <br></p>
