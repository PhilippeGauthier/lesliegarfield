<p>Last night we had our Annual Townhouse Seminar at the University Club. Every year it seems as though this event gets more and more popular. We changed the format up a bit this year and created a panel vs. individual speakers at a podium and it worked well. We had a lot of inquiry last night as people were leaving asking how they could contact the speakers so I have compiled a list of their contact information below.</p><p>Thank you everyone who came out in the rain. The event was a huge success.<br></p><p>Watch for video clips on the great information our speakers gave us last night.<br></p><p>Laura Twomey, Partner, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP – Trusts & Estates<br></p><p>425 Lexington Avenue New York, NY 10017 <br></p><p>Email: ltwomey@stblaw.com<br></p><p>Phone: 1-212-455-3120<br></p><p><br></p><p>Todd R.
