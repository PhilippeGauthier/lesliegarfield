<p>But
 what of that townhouse buyer who feels guilty slathering the woodwork 
in Benjamin Moore? Or even worse: ripping out those lovely paneled walls
 to get the master bedroom suite or open-flow feel they’ve always 
wanted? Surely, they might benefit from an interior that leaves them 
feeling less tortured?<br></p><p>Indeed,
 even the more extreme old house devotees usually prefer a somewhat 
updated aesthetic, brokers report, to say nothing of the masses who like
 their charm and period detail watered down.

</p><p>“I
 think that’s in the minority,” said Mr. Pretsfelder, of those who 
request a lot of old detail. “People like what I would call the 15 CPW 
model. Which is sort of grander proportions of the old world 
construction, old world touches, molding, things like that. Not 
overdone, not so dark. Much of the molding and woodwork you do see is 
lighter woods or painted white.”
</p><p>There
 are people—“certainly not the majority”—who do want old world, dark 
wood detail throughout the house, he conceded. And they’re often not who
 you’d expect. For example, he was recently showing some properties to a
 young tech titan who’d made his money in Silicon Valley, the type of 
person who you’d think would be into the “quintessential more modern 
aesthetic,” but “[was] very excited about details.”
</p><p>Still, he maintained, “three-fourths of the buyers are looking for old world proportion with a modern touch.”
</p><p>Very
 modern also has a rather niche appeal. He cited a “super-funky 
staircase of Lucite” or “atriums, where you lose some of the living room
 square footage to create a double-height ceiling,” as features that 
have turned off buyers.
</p><p>If
 contemporary interiors with just a smattering of period details are 
really what a lot of people want, why not just buy new? Are the new 
development offerings really so charmless?
