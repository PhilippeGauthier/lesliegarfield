<p>New York City is the kind of place that all sorts of people can call home. No matter how you choose to spend your time, you can find somewhere to spend it with others who share your taste. While your options are hardly limited in any area of our dearly diverse and ever surprising city, there are very definitive concentrations of communities of people with common interests in every given neighborhood. Socialites on the Upper East, foodies in Hell's Kitchen, rockers on the Lower East Side; different types of people gather in different areas to live different lifestyles.</p><p>So what does this observation mean for home buyers?<br></p><p>Two points. Firstly, and more obviously, consider how you want to spend your time before buying. Make sure the neighborhood you look in fits your personality. Yes your purchase is an investment, but first and foremost it will be your home! Location is just as vital to your happiness with your purchase as the quality of the home you buy. Secondly, consider your neighbors-to-be in terms of how you can expect the area to appreciate. Historically speaking, areas bound for greater appreciation are full of musicians and artists. This phenomenon has been realized in now prime areas of most major cities. Montmartre in Paris was once a terribly undesirable neighborhood while it was developing into the cultural center that acted as the lens that brought the prominent Jazz scene into focus for the entire city.<br></p><p>Moral of the story: when hunting for your home, follow your ear!<span></span><br></p>
