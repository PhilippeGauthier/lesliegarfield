<p>It’s true that the market seems to have slowed a tick or two in the previous couple of months, but one thing is for sure: there is still a fair amount of inventory available. What are not bountifully available are 25’ wide townhouses. Whether that’s simply because there are fewer “25 footers” in existence or just that the owners of those properties don’t want to let them go is beyond me. Regardless, the extra width in this space-starved city goes an incredibly long way!
</p><p>Take the home we have for sale at <a href="http://www.lesliegarfield.com/Properties/viewproperty/53671TH">60 West 83rd Street</a>   for example. The extra width in the house allowed the current owners to split the rear of the top floor of their triplex unit into three separate bedrooms for their three kids! Even if you have a huge 8,000 or 9,000 square foot house, you can’t do that with just 20 feet. Even without kids, or any specific intent with the extra space, the sheer possibilities created are compelling.<br>
</p><p>Given both the constraint in 25’ wide inventory and the perks extra width offer leads to a price per square foot premium on those properties. Depending on your needs, it may very well be worth it to pay that premium!<span></span><br>
