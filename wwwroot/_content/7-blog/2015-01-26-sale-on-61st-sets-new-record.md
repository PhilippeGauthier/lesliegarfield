<p>After another strong performance last year, the townhouse market in the East 60’s continues to reach new heights in 2015. We are proud to report the recent sale of 211 East 61st Street. This newly renovated 5 story, 18’-wide single family home, which was asking $10,995,000, has been sold for just under asking price. This represents the highest price ever paid for a property within the Treadwell Farms Historic District.</p><p>Opportunities remain in the market, despite competition amongst buyers. A property just two doors down from 211 East 61st Street at 215 East 61st Street can be purchased for $6,350,000. This property, which has already been gutted and had an elevator shaft put in place, represents an ideal opportunity for a buyer with vision to make their dream home.<br></p><p>With demand strong, and relatively low inventory levels, sales figures look to remain strong in the coming months. The handsome limestone townhouse at 232 East 68th Street is one example of a well located renovated property of almost 5,000 square feet that can still be purchased for under the new $10,000,000 benchmark.<span></span><br></p>
