<p>Over the past 24 months sales in the East 60s have witnessed a significant rise in value.  The properties that commanded the highest values were single-family homes, 14 of which were sold during this time.
</p><p>2014 Sales totaled 8 single-family home transactions, the most expensive being 16 East 95th Street, a single-family house located between Fifth and Madison Avenues.  This home was sold for $19,600,000, which translated to $3,513 per square foot. The overall price per square foot of $3,513 exceeded any other sale during the prior two years. This price can be attributed both to its location, on the Fifth – Madison block, and to the fact that this house had been “gut” renovated and was in pristine condition. The overall average sale in the neighborhood for the year was just under $2,000 per square foot.<br>
</p><p>The least expensive transaction during 2014 was on the Park - Lexington block at 127 East 92nd Street and was sold by an estate. The acquirer immediately offered it out on the market and at the time of writing is negotiating a significantly higher sales price.<br>
</p><p>In 2013 there were only 6 single-family home transactions. In an anomaly the highest sales transaction took place between Park and Lexington at 135 East 94th Street which sold for $7,900,000 or $2,351 per square foot. The overall average sale in 2013 was $1,100 per square foot.<span></span><br>
