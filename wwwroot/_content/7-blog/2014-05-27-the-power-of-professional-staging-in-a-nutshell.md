<p>When in doubt, consider a stager. Here's why.  A buyer walks into a townhouse, well priced, pretty block, has all the apparent signs of being relatively easy to sell. Then it sits on the market for no apparent, logical reason. Case in point, a 3 story house came to market on East 84th Street, priced just under $5million, roughly $2,000 psf. Within a week of being listed, offers came in and they went to best and final. While the house had had some renovation done to it, it was limited to 3 bedrooms and was only 2,100 square feet.  How does this happen? Staging, buyers are taken in by nicely made beds, simple, elegant decor and an open kitchen.</p><p>Contrary to what some might think, size doesn't always matter.  But looks almost always do. I can go on with similar examples such 107 East 91st, a lovely 15' wide 6 bedroom townhouse listed just under $8mm.  When it first hit the market it was tired looking, gave off the impression that while nice space, 6 beds, a great garden and a pretty street, it just needed too much.  Buyers, rather than notice all the positives, focused on the negatives.  Professional stagers stepped in, house is transformed. Showings have increased dramatically and buyers can now envision themselves living there without too much necessary work.  Similar examples can be recently seen on a townhouse on East 94th Street and on East 69th Street, townhouses that sold at premiums after professional stagers came in and did their thing.  Prices for staging varies depending on the size of the house and how many rooms you are looking to redo.  And always remember, if staging is not an option, a paint job, clean sweep and some fresh flowers also go a long way too.<br></p><p>107 East 91st Street before and after staging.<span></span><br></p><p><br></p>
