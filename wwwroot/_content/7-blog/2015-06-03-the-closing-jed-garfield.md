<p>Jed Garfield is the owner of Leslie J. Garfield Real Estate, the residential townhouse-focused brokerage founded by his father in 1972. Garfield has personally sold more than 600 townhouses — some more than once — during his 30-year real estate career in New York. His conquests have included the record-setting sales of the <a href="http://therealdeal.com/blog/2006/01/10/ex-cab-driver-buys-duke-semans-mansion/">Duke Semans Mansion</a> at 1009 Fifth Avenue for $40 million in 2006 and the Japanese embassy at 11-13 East 62nd Street for $21 million in 1999. Born and raised in Manhattan, Garfield started in real estate as a leasing agent at Grubb & Ellis, but joined the family business in 1990. In 2003, he bought the brokerage from his father, who is now in his 80s and is still working at the firm.
