<p>Recently, two houses in the East 70s have sold for huge numbers in off market transactions.  116 East 70th Street, the five story townhouse between Park and Lexington Avenues that was owned by billionaire George Soros’s ex-wife, Susan Weber Soros, sold for $31,000,000, just over $4,780 per square foot.  This home underwent a large renovation before Soros purchased the house in 2012 to convert it from a two family house to the charming single-family residence that it is today.
</p><p>A few blocks north and west, just steps off of Fifth Avenue, the five-story townhouse at 11 East 75th Street sold for $29,700,000. This townhome, which has been a multifamily residence for about 75 years, was purchased in the midst of an extensive renovation.  When complete (most likely sometime next spring), plans suggest the home will boast a restored brick façade and the addition of a limestone base with a center entrance.  However, from the looks of it, the biggest changes to 11 East 75th Street will remain unseen from the street, as the interior of this house will be returned to a stunning single family home.<span></span><br>
