<p>The "Tallest Residential Building in in the Western Hemisphere", 432 Park Avenue, has the design aesthetic and forethought of a metal radiator grille turned upward. The architect and developer were just WRONG in the design concept and execution of this vastly ugly and out of place structure. One can only hope that the interiors are so well fitted and designed that once one arrives home, he/she will forget they live in the most ill-proportioned building in all of Manhattan. Unfortunately no one else in the entire city will be able to forget about it!</p>
