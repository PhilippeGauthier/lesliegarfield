<p>Lloyd Goldman sells Midtown East buildings for $18M.  The buildings together span 20,750 square feet on Second Avenue between 49th and 50th streets, and come with 30,000 square feet of additional air rights. Gould Investors, a Great Neck-based real estate investment firm, is buying the properties and is looking to hold on to them long term. In total, the site could hold 50,000 build able square feet. With an inclusionary zoning bonus, however, that number could go up to 60,000.</p>
