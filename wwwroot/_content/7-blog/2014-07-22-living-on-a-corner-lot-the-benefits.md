<p>A beautiful house that sits on a prime corner is for sale. Well priced,  just under $4mm, good block in the heart of Murray Hill, and well situated for commuters as it's just blocks from Grand Central, but it has yet to find its new owners.  I listed this house at 136 E 38th street several months ago but buyer anxiety prevails. Some points to consider when looking at a corner townhouse: Try not to be too thrown off by the fact that you are not "mid block." The benefits of the corner is great light exposure you wouldnt ordinarily get sandwiched between 2 houses. Another benefit in this instance is signage. While being on the corner of Lexington Avenue may raise eyebrows, owners have free parking in exchange for a parking sign placed on the side of the property. A corner oftentimes has the benefit of R10 zoning which carries with it significantly more FAR (buildable square footage) and oftentimes allows for mixed commercial/residential use. When I walk through 136 E. 38th Street, I hear nothing of the outside due to city silent windows that were installed. Couldn't be quieter. Be open, the positives can be worth it.<span></span></p>
