<p>The day Leslie J. Garfield opened the firm’s doors in 1972, he had a singular focus in mind: to be the best. For him, that meant being the most knowledgeable, the hardest working and an honest negotiator for clients.</p><p>While Leslie’s ambition is still deeply rooted in our DNA, the world of real estate has evolved, and so have we as a company.<br></p><p>Today, markets move at lightning speed and information has become a commodity. Our teams have wider reach, and the latest tools in their pockets to share and consume up-to-the-minute information on properties, all around the world. Yet true insight — a better perspective on properties, the market and transactions backed by a track record of success —  remains the most relevant currency. <br></p><p>We have spent the last year focusing our offer and approach around these key beliefs. And last week we introduced an updated visual identity that gives us the right tools and communication look to bring these beliefs to life, clarify what we really think matters in real estate and provides our clients with a platform to cut through the clutter.<br></p><p>Combined with our new partnership with <a href="http://www.beauchamp.co.uk/" target="_blank">Beauchamp Estates</a> in the UK, Europe and Israel, we believe this will ensure success for our clients and our role as the premier Townhouse and small building broker in New York and beyond.<br></p><p>We’re here to help you to make better decisions about the future of your property. Just as we’ve always been.<br></p>
