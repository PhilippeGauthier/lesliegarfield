<p class="MsoNormal">With the year coming to an end, let’s take a moment to look
back on the three of the most expensive residential townhouse transactions in the East 70’s
during 2015. </p><p class="MsoNormal">The third most expensive residential transaction in the neighborhood was the sale of Brandeis University's alumni
house located at 12 East 77<sup>th</sup> Street for $32M back in 
February. The house, a 25’ wide property in need of
renovation, was owned by the university for over half a century before 
they decided the house was too small for the university's growing alumni
 population in NYC.  The second most expensive sale was the sale of 41 
East 70<sup>th</sup> Street.   This
28’ wide home has traded hands three times in the past three years: In 2012 the
property sold for $25M, in 2013 the property sold for $32M and most recently
sold for $33M.  The most expensive sale
in the neighborhood was 125 East 70<sup>th</sup> Street which closed at the
beginning of the year for $37M .  This
rare, 40’ wide, 11,000 square foot home was designed by Bunny Mellon in the
French classic style. The Mellons sold the property in 2006.  </p><p class="MsoNormal">Currently
 there are two houses on the market in the East 70's above $30M.  7 East
 76th Street is asking $50M while 39 East 72nd Street is asking $42.  
Could one or both of these make the top three for 2016?</p>
