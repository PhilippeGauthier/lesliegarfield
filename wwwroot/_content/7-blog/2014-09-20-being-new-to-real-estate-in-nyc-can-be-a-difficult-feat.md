<p>One might wonder what it is like to be a new broker in Manhattan now a days, well lucky for you I can give you a brief snap shot of my experience so far.  I started working with Leslie J. Garfield about two months ago, two days after moving into the city from my hometown outside of Boston.  Having previously worked in the health care industry, my New York real estate knowledge was minimal, mostly information that I had learned through the licensing course, and I knew that I was going to have to learn things fast…I just didn’t realize how fast. </p><p>The first week was, to say the least, overwhelming.  There was a ton of information to learn not only about the properties we have on the market, but also about the townhouse market in general.  Figuring out what was on the market, new to the market, recently sold, etc. took up most of my workdays.  Not to mention, I was still trying to figure out which way to turn when walking from the subway station to the office.<br></p><p>What has made this giant transition easier for me, is that the Garfields, as well as each and every person in the Leslie J Garfield office, have been exceptional with helping me acclimate to my new city and new career.  Through the other brokers I am quickly learning about the townhouse market in Manhattan, particularly the Upper East Side, and what is expected of an expert in this area of the industry.  Each day is a new experience and I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge in this industry.<br></p><p>To find out more about Caylyn, see her agent page <a href="http://lesliegarfield.com/agent/25">HERE</a>. <br></p>
