<p>The Hudson Yards development will be the true catalyst to New York City’s Real Estate renaissance.  The Hudson Yards will be a city within a city the likes of which nobody has ever seen.  It will not be built on land but on elevated platforms.  By an elevated platform I mean a monolithic roof housing a busy New York railroad.  The railroad will continue uninterrupted as the Hudson Yard’s development soars above.
</p><p>The Hudson Yards will be a joint venture between the Related Companies, founded by famed Real Estate tycoon Stephen Ross and Oxford Properties Group of Canada.  Located on the Manhattan’s far West Side it occupies most of the area between 30th and 34rd Streets, and extends from 10th Avenue two blocks to the West Side Highway that hugs the Hudson River. When fully completed sometime around 2024, the Hudson Yards, including nearby buildings developed by Related, will comprise 20 million square feet of offices, apartments, and retail outlets, a U.S. record for a single development. A $2.4 billion extension of the number 7 subway line, connecting the Hudson Yards to Times Square and 17 of the City’s 21 subway lines, will start transporting passengers in early 2015. <br>
</p><p>There is no doubt this will be a challenging endeavor, but something that will capture the world’s eye and truly cement New York City as the Real Estate capital of the world. <br>
