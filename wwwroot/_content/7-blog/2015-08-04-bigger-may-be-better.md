<p>The typical townhouse usually ranges in size from 4 stories and 16' wide to 5 stories and 20' wide with standard square footage ranging from 3,500 to 6,500 square feet. These are large spaces by New York City standards, but may not be large enough for some. </p><p>Several projects come to mind where owners have already begun combining two or three abutting townhouses, with other combinations currently being marketed. The most noteworthy combination currently circulating around the City are the three adjacent townhouses located at 12, 14 and 16 East 62nd Street for $120.0 million. The combined property would have 73 feet of frontage and approximately 30,000 square feet. Another combination of note will occur at 11, 13 and 15 East 75th Street where 55 feet of frontage will be created for a purchase price approximating $70.0 million. On the Upper West Side several combinations are also under way including 130-132 West 70th Street, with five stories and a combined frontage of 36 feet and 12-14 West 83rd Street with 4 stories also with 36 feet of frontage, and potentially 48-50 West 69th Street with 5 stories and 40 feet of frontage. These combinations are not for the faint of heart, judging by the several years it has taken for the projects at West 70th and West 83rd Street. There are both significant architectural and landmark issues involved in these combinations, which feed into the prolonged timelines to complete these projects. But, in a market where townhouse width is the brass ring for the ultra-wealthy, these combinations are certainly consistent with the notion that bigger, may in fact be better.
