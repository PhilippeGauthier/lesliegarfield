<p>As the chaotic New York City real estate market continues in stride with prices rising and inventory decreasing, the brokerage size remains steady leading to increased competition throughout the various neighborhoods. </p><p>Back in February of 2013 when 113 Bedford Street was put on the market, brokers and owners took note of record-breaking price per square foot sales in the West Village.  Having pitched the business two months earlier and soon after finding out I was not hired, I quickly learned I was clearly not as optimistic and aggressively priced in my valuation as other brokers were.  With a valuation at $5,500,000 and a suggested ask of $5,750,000, obviously based on comparable sales on the surrounding blocks, I was shocked to see the property hit the market at $7,900,000.  Twenty months and two brokerage firms later, it seems as though the once soon to be optimistic brokers over promised and underperformed. Christopher Riccio and Matthew Pravda of Leslie Garfield are proud to announce their exclusive agency of 113 Bedford Street, for private tours and pricing please inquire at 212-574-6962. <br></p><p>For further information visit <a href="http://www.Lesliegarfield.com">www.Lesliegarfield.com</a><span></span><br></p>
