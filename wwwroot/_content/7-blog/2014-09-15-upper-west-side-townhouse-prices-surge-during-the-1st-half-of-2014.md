<p>The 1st half of calendar year 2014 sales of Upper West Side (the neighborhood bounded by 68th and 110th Streets to the South and North and Central Park West and Riverside Drive to the East and West) residential, commercial, and institutional townhouses and small buildings showed signs of a strong market.  Comparing the first half of 2014 to 2013, the average sales price surged 38.3%% from $5.8 million to $8.0 million while the average Price Per Square Foot (PPSF) rose 15.4% from $959. $1,106 Transaction volume for the period was down with a total of 26 transactions during the first half of 2014 vs. 37 during the same period of 2013.  The most expensive townhouse sale during the 1st half of 2014 was the sale by Leslie Garfield & Co., Inc at 47 West 70th Street for $19.3 million and $2,570/ft. Other sales of note include 41 West 74th Street for $16.3 million and $1,988/ft. and 226 West 71st Street for $14.0 million and $1,732/ft.</p><p>Looking at the market by neighborhood over the last four quarters, the park blocks  between 68th and 79th Street  was the strongest market with an average price of $9.2  million, and an average PPSF of $1,334. Park blocks as a whole ($8.2 million and $1,237/ft) outpaced the Columbus-West End Avenue corridor ($6.1 million and $926/ft.), and 1-2 unit homes continued to command the highest prices with an average price of $1,415/ft. <br></p><p>Looking forward, inventory is somewhat low with approximately 42 properties on the market. Of these properties, an astounding 24 are asking more than $10.0 million, demonstrating the rapid appreciation of real estate values in the neighborhood, and at the same time creating a slow down in transaction volume as the market settles on a new pricing structure.<span></span><br></p>
