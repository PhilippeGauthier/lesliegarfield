<p>Location is and always has been the prime motivating factor when purchasing luxury real estate. How many times have I been asked by brokers and buyers: "what's it between? How far from the Park?"</p><p>Well if you want to be close to the park and don't want to pay the premium for it, try the "other" park, Carl Schurz Park, a beautiful stretch along East End north of 79th Street that is quiet, tranquil and truly beautiful. A single family home in this neck of the woods is considerably cheaper than if it were West of Park. As an example, 546 E 87th Street, a beautifully renovated 3,500 sf townhouse is under contract for $6,200,000, West of park tack on a minimum of another $2mm.<br></p><p>A 30 footer along East East Avenue (142 EEA) newly constructed with panoramic views of the East River is on for $8.5m, an unheard of price West of Park Ave. Just consider keeping your options open and allowing for the possibility of a new and different perspective. You may be pleasantly surprised.<span></span></p>
