<p>Over the past year, sales prices in the East 70s were among the highest in the Upper East Side.  With seven sales over $20 million dollars and six of those properties selling for over $3,000 per square foot, 2014 was by far the strongest year for sales in this neighborhood’s history.</p><p>To no surprise, two of the $20 million plus sales took place on the beautiful residential block of 70th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues. The year started off with the sale of 115 East 70th for $51 million, and drew to a close with the sale of 116 East 70th Street for $31 million.  Both were renovated single family homes.<br></p><p>Looking at the East 70’s sales as a whole, the average sales price during 2014 was $18.8 million while the average price per square foot was $2,214.  The most expensive sale that took place was the sale mentioned above at 115 East 70th Street while the least expensive sale was at 339 East 75th Street, a mixed-use property that sold for $4,700,000. <span></span><br></p>
