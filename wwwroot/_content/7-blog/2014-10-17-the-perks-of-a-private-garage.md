<p>The automatic assumption would likely be that owning a townhouse with a private garage is a luxury any townhouse owner would want. To pull into your house and park, without the hassle having to pay for a parking garage. Who wouldn't want that?  The answer is probably no one. There are actually very few townhouses out there on the Upper East Side that have curb cuts and active garages. It is virtually impossible to get approval these days from the DOB and the DOT as everyone renovating would want one.  There are significant limitations making it very difficult to get approval, including needing to be a certain proximity to the Avenue, and having enough frontage (25' minimum) to permit it.  </p><p>Surprisingly, a house at 308 East 81st Street is for sale offering not only 5,000 square feet of interior footage, but a private garage and curb cut as well with just 15' of frontage. Sounds unbelievable but it's true. The garage was installed and approved prior to these strict guidelines and is one of the last known one family homes that has an approved garage with these dimensions.  Interesting to note, the house, while a 15 footer, does not feel constricting one bit and the garage does not take away from the interior space at all because it was re built 10 years ago and is built back 67 feet on every floor including the cellar.  Something to consider if looking for a home. Why not accept this wonderful perk that is so rare to find. </p>
