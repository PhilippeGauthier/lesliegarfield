<p>While the skyrocketing demand and prices for single family townhouses in Brooklyn 
Heights has been well-publicized, very few residents are aware of the 
surging retail values in the area. Mixed-use buildings have become 
highly coveted as investors seek opportunities to capitalize on the 
strong local luxury residential market.</p><p><br></p><p>For
 example, T-Mobile recently signed a record-breaking $200 per square 
foot lease for a 2,220 square foot space at 93 Court Street. This set a 
new standard for this busy retail strip that runs from Atlantic Avenue 
to Montague Street. Earlier this year, high-end cafe Paris Baguette 
opened just two doors down at 97 Court Street. In that area, retail 
rents have increased from approximately $125 per square foot in 2013, to
 nearly $200 per square foot last year. And along Montague Street, 
retail rents are now pushing past $150 per square foot.</p><p><br></p><p>This
 trend has affected commercial building values as well. Two investment 
firms recently teamed up to purchase 142 Montague Street for $8.5 
million (approximately $850 per square foot). The reasoning behind the 
purchase was the potential longterm upside in the two retail spaces. 
Investors now believe Brooklyn Heights may be the next SoHo - a prime 
neighborhood where luxury residential real estate will lead to high-end 
luxury retailers willing to pay higher rent for access to wealthy local 
residents.</p><p><br></p><p>Only
 time will tell if Brooklyn Heights retail will reach SoHo-like levels. 
But as the Brooklyn Heights residential market thrives, one thing is 
certain - investors will continue to seek out these value-add 
opportunities in the local retail market.</p><p><br></p>
