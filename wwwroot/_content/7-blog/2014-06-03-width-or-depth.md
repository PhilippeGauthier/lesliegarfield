<p>Those who know townhouses know that buyers are sensitive to width and often state "they aren't interested in anything less than 20'-wide". While of course wider is better, with a sub $10m budget this isn't always possible.</p><p>What is often overlooked is the depth of the home. With a deeper build front and back rooms can be larger and the middle core can accommodate an elevator, powder rooms or two bathrooms (back to back).</p><p>I recently went to contract on an unrenovated 17' wide home built 59' deep. Once renovated into a single family home, entertaining rooms will be approximately 15.5' x 25' and individual bedroom sizes will be approximately 15.5' x 15' which are both nice sized rooms. The core can then accommodate a large dressing area or two baths depending on which floor (master or kids/guest) and the back a large bath or additional bedroom.</p><p>Because of this perception, the market discounts sub 20'-wide properties. It's time to recognize the value instead of knocking it!</p><p>If you're looking for helpful designs I know how to help. I'm not an architect but I know what people want.<span></span></p>
